this is the visual Implementation of dijkstra algorithm for finding the shortest path in a graph , I have used JFrame, Graph and eventListner for graphBoard where you can create 
graph (vertex and undirected edges ) ,How to create and implement the project read below
To create vertex take mouse where u want to create vertex -> left click -> it will assign an id automaticallly
to create an edge right click on the source vertex and the destination vertex -> a dialog box appears -> enter the weight 
After creating the graph 
Select the source vertex from where u want to find the best path to all the vertices
click on find button -> A dialog window appears which will show u the path shortest path and the value and the shortest weight .
